# C - Malloc

## Introduction
> This README is for the C - Malloc project at Atlas. The purpose of this project was to recreate the functionality of the C malloc Function.
> Along with a simplified malloc and a full malloc, we also implemented a free, realloc, and calloc functions.
> Many of the Challanges for this project came from trying to understand how malloc uses blocks of metadata for navigating newly created memory
